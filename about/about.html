        <h1>About VoiceFlow</h1>

        <h2>
            VoiceFlow is a vocal training platform designed specifically for musicians and singers, enabling them to warm up their voices before performances. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced performer, VoiceFlow offers a range of customizable exercises tailored to suit every skill level. The platform allows users to choose between diverse personalized warm-up routines, helping them gradually improve their vocal technique.
        </h2>
        <h2>
            In addition to the exercises, VoiceFlow provides an engaging way for users to monitor their progress over time, allowing them to visualize improvements and continue refining their vocal abilities in the broader context of gamification. Our goal is to create a comprehensive space where singers and musicians alike can prepare their voices for any performance, all while fostering growth and development.
        </h2>
        <h2>
            One of the key aspects of the training game, the pitch tracker, was also furtherly developed, and a dedicated page for this useful tool was also added. We believed that the functionalities of this powerful tool were too good to be relegated to a side part of the project, so we decided to give it a dignity of its own.
        </h2>
        <h2>
            The technologies implied in the development of the web app are diverse, and range from modern web audio APIs, such as Tone.js; to sample libraries, such as Salamander Grand Piano on Github; to real-time databases, such as FireBase FireStore.
        </h2>
        <h2>
            This project was developed as the final project for the Advanced Coding Tools and Methodology course in the Music and Acoustic Engineering program at Politecnico di Milano by Michele Zanardi, Gianluigi Vecchini, Federico Capitani, and Ä°pek Ceren Bayram.
